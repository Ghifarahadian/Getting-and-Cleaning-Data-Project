'subject' and 'activity' are categorical variables. The rest are measurement variables
All measurement variables come with mean and standard deviation measurements
Those with (X, Y, Z) have both mean and standard deviation measurements in X, Y, and Z direction
't' indicates time domain, 'f' indicates frequency domain

subject
  numbers from 1 to 30. It indicates 30 individuals that have their data collected
activity
  consists of "STANDING", "SITTING", "LAYING", "WALKING", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS".
  This is the activity performed by the subject during the measurement
